Bot Simple

This is code from one of the projects I've worked on through the JetBrains Academy

Project description: Creating a Simple Chat Bot in Java

these are the functions I have implemented

Greet
The bot Greets the user and tells its name and when it was created.
Then askes the user for their name
RemindName
Takes a string input for the name and prints out a confirmation which has the string which they inputted
GuessAge
The bot guesses the users age by asking them to divide their age by 3 numbers (3, 5 and 7).
It calculates the age using the answer given by the user
Count
Asks the user to enter a number
A loop starts which prints out all the numbers starting from 0 till the input is reached
Test
A multiple choice question is printed out
The user needs to enter the correct answer
if the wrong answer is entered a message is printed out that asks the user to enter the choice again
if the choice is correct a while loop is exited and the function ends
